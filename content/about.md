# About Neat Systems

Neat Systems is a consultancy helping startups from Seed to C evaluate and optimize their systems to avoid letting growth get in the way of your goals. Founder [Margaret Fero](https://www.margaretfero.com/) began Neat Systems after repeatedly running into the same set of growth-related problems at many startups. Margaret ran into many of the same issues at specific thresholds of scale as a security professional that they had seen as a technical writer *and* in their support of marketing teams. Rather than continue approaching the same problems from different angles, they decided to offer a systemic approach to treat the root causes of startups' growing pains.
