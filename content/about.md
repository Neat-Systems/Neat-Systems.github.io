# About This Site

You can see the full info about what I'm using here on [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/Neat-Systems/Neat-Systems.github.io), but a few key things that I'm using are:
- [11ty](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy) as the static site generator for the site overall
- [eleventy-base-blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) as my main source for layout, though I've modified it
- [11ty-links](https://github.com/BenjaminEHowe/11ty-links/) for the LinkTree-style page! Note that I'm not actually pulling in this package as a dependency because I'm not using CloudFlare for email.
