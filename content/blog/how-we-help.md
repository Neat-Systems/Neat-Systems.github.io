Neat Systems believes that building a sustainable organization ready to thrive in times of rapid growth requires a holistic approach to business problems. The business problems and subject areas on which we focus are often separated from each other or thought of as disparate disciplines, including technical communication, marketing, and information security. By focusing on the flow of information through these interrelated systems, many seemingly-separate problems can be resolved by treating a shared root cause. Crucially, some of these root causes are natural and inherent aspects of achieving funders' common goals for venture capital rounds. As such, they can't be prevented without also blocking growth.

Common growth-related startup communication and information storage problems arise around growth inflection points roughly corresponding to common venture capital (VC) funding rounds. For each scale, a handful of shared root causes contribute to the majority of organizational systems breakdown common at that phase. Some symptoms will manifest differently for fully-remote or remote-first organizations than for organizations with some office presence on a weekly basis or more. For more on the challenges you can expect at each stage of growth, check out our blog [Growth Challenges at VC Scale](https://neatsystems.dev/blog/vc-rounds-growth-challenges/).

Neat Systems helps organizations starting to notice that, as you grow, some information is where it doesn't belong and other information has gone missing. With scale comes organizational chaos that you must streamline to avoid letting growth get in the way of your goals. If you've started a company before, you might recognize when the growing pains you experienced last time are starting to arise again. You've got the perfect opportunity to anticipate the future pain of those burgeoning problems before they come to full fruition. If it's your first startup, congratulations! Your proactive planning to grow mindfully will pay off both metaphorically and literally. As you grow, you either know or are about to learn that your organization will undergo a number of shifts in the years to come. Initially, a small number of people (the founders) hold shared responsibility for everything and are deeply involved in all decisions. Over time, your organization will expand to include more people with specialized skills and responsibilities distributed throughout the larger group.

Neat Systems focuses on how your organization manages information throughout that growth: making sure information is exactly where it needs to be, and nowhere else. This may involve:

-   Setting up communication structures that empower employees to share information appropriately.
-   Systems-thinking-driven process analysis to determine how well particular working patterns are serving you.
-   Tactical work, like creating or improving documentation, automating organizational maintenance and communication processes, or introducing compliance-style controls and automating remediation. 

The bulk of this work, however, is often evaluating how the overall patterns your organization is setting align to your values and mission.

Traditionally, this work may have been driven by an early full-time employee (FTE) in one or more of these different disciplines who focused primarily on the impact within that discipline. In the current funding environment, many organizations seek to delay this foundational work until there's capacity to dedicate FTE time to it. However, this is not the kind of optional project that you can push indefinitely into the future with no penalty. Communication systems design gets worse and harder as an organization grows, and hampers your organization's effectiveness in the meanwhile. If you're not going to push cultural and communication systems work into the future and you don't have capacity to invest heavily in it now, though, prioritization and strategy become critical. That's where Neat Systems can help.

# Recognizing Success

A successful Neat Systems engagement is characterized both by what you don't see and what you do. First, a successful client should see minimal or no _reactive_ compliance emergencies, where someone alleges that the organization violated a standard with which you intended to comply. Reactive compliance emergencies happen when the organization isn't communicating clearly about what needs to be done and acting on shared priorities. Additionally, employees should not feel like they need to leave the system they're working in to acquire information needed to do their job.

Our successful clients won't see reactive compliance emergencies, but what about _proactive_ compliance emergencies? A proactive compliance emergency typically means there's a sales contract on the line, and you must agree to comply with new future obligations to close that sale. With successful management of the growth problems Neat Systems helps with, several sales metrics should benefit, including decreases in:

-   mean time to close
-   number of cycles on Vendor Security Questionnaires (VSQs), especially compliance and information management questions, and
-   differences in your sales funnel based on organization size at the phase of the sales cycle where your industry handles compliance and information management considerations. Mean time to close and cycles on VSQs speak for themselves, but that last one can be trickier. Different verticals handle compliance and information management at different stages of the sales cycle. Whenever that is for your clients, sales teams commonly suffer extra delays at that stage as the organization grows. With successful implementation of Neat Systems recommendations, those delays should be minimized to let sales teams move through the entire cycle without obstruction from (or needing to obstruct) other parts of the organization.

Most importantly, Neat Systems seeks to improve your employee experience and productivity by decreasing repeat work and friction. Even as you grow, employees should consistently feel like they:

-   have the information needed to do their job.
-   feel confident updating processes, whether directly or with their team.
-   know when and how to update processes they use or influence.
-   know where and how to store information safely, and without much effort. The easiest way should be the right way.

By approaching resolution of business problems as a shared goal to be achieved as a team, organizations can optimize every employee's effort for a better work experience and a more successful business.
